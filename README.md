# Chasing Phishing URLs  

This repository contains the **code, report, and evaluation results** for the **machine learning framework** developed for detecting phishing URLs as part of the *Pattern Recognition* course at the **University of Coimbra (2024/2025)**.  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to **classify phishing and legitimate URLs** using multiple **supervised learning algorithms**.  
Several **feature selection**, **scaling**, and **dimensionality reduction** techniques were explored to evaluate their effect on model performance and generalization.  
The study compares various classifiers, including **Minimum Distance**, **Linear and Quadratic Bayes**, **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, applied to the **PhiUSIIL Phishing URL Dataset** containing over 235,000 labeled samples.  

## Available Files  
- **`URLs2.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation pipeline, from preprocessing to model evaluation.  
- **`ReportRP_ChasingPhishingURLs_2.pdf`** – Detailed project report describing methodology, feature engineering, models, and results.  

**The dataset is NOT provided in this repository** due to licensing restrictions.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-Learn, NumPy, Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**
